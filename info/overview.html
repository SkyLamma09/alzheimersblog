        <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects numerous cognitive functions such
as memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for nearly
60-80% of dementia cases worldwide (National Library of Medicine). This disease leads to progressive
decline in cognitive abilities, with it often starting with mild memory loss, such as misplacing frequently
used items (Clevland Clinic), and can also lead to severe cognitive impairment, which includes even
forgetting how to walk. (NursePartners). As of today, there is no cure, but with scientists and society
working together, we can hopefully move towards a day when Alzheimer’s doesn’t exist.
The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease develop slowly and worsen over time. They can be represented by
the 7 stages of Alzheimer's as follows 1. No Impairment → You have no symptoms, and you are functioning normally
2. Very mild Decline → You might have some slight memory lapses, such as misplacing your keys, and
this is often not that noticeable
3. Mild Decline → Friends and family can start to notice your memory issues, and you will likely have
trouble finding words or remembering names
4 . Moderate Decline → You’re symptoms are now clear, you are forgetting events that have happened
recently, and the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is a possibility. You can also lose awareness of time
5. Moderate to Severe Decline → You need help with daily activities such as choosing clothes, and you
can no longer live independently as your memory and communication skills deteriorate. This stage
usually lasts around 1 - 1.5 years.
6. Severe Decline → Your memory is severely impaired, you can forget the names of your family
members, have trouble speaking, and even expect some behavioral changes.
7. Very Severe Decline → You are in the last stage of Alzheimer’s, and you have lost your ability to
respond, speak, or even control how you move. You need 24/7 surveillance and care. At this stage, some
people may even be bedridden or infantile.
The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear, but as of now, scientists believe that there are
multiple factors, such as genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle quality. Two hallmarks of
Alzheimer’s disease are the accumulation of two abnormal protein deposits in the brain, which include
amyloid plaques and tau tangles. These abnormalities can disrupt communication between different brain
cells, leading to death.
Several Risk Factors Include →
1. Age: Age is the most significant risk factor because most people with Alzheimer’s are 65 or older,
with the risk increasing significantly after each passing decade after 65. (Alzheimer’s Society)
2. Genetics: Family history can play a role in determining whether or not you are prone to
Alzheimer's. Certain genes, especially the APOE ε4 gene, are linked to an increased risk of
Alzheimer's, although not everyone with this gene will develop Alzheimer’s (National Institute
of Aging)
3. Heart health and Lifestyle factors: Having heart and blood-related problems, such as high blood
pressure, heart disease, and excess cholesterol, can all increase the risk of developing
alzheimers.This is caused by a bad lifestyle which includes, lack of physical activity, poor diet,
smoking, and even social isolation.
While there is no cure for Alzheimer's yet, there are numerous ways people can help those affected by the
disease, as well as contribute to research efforts.
1. Support Caregivers: Caregiving for someone with Alzheimer’s is an exhausting job. Offering
respite care by giving them time to rest, helping with household chores, or even just simply
providing emotional support can make a huge difference.
2. Raising Awareness: Educating others is important, including about the disease’s symptoms, and
how to provide support. This can help reduce stigma and encourage more people to seek early
diagnosis and treatment.
3. Contributing to research: Financial support for Alzheimer’s research can help the discovery of
new treatment options, improve early detection, and ultimately find a cure. Many organizations,
such as the Alzheimer’s Association and Alzheimer’s Research UK, are dedicated to funding
research.
Alzheimers disease is a cruel disease that affects millions across borders. While we don’t have a cure right
now, with more people being aware of this disease, we will have already moved one step closer in the
mission to find a cure for this disease.</p>
