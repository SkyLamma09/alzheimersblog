                <h1>Finding Joy in Small Moments</h1>
                <p>When my husband, James, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at just 58, our world turned upside down. As a former college professor, he had always been the most articulate person I knew. Watching him struggle to find words in those early months was heartbreaking. But somewhere along this difficult journey, we discovered a new way to connect that didn't rely on words.</p>
                <p>We began focusing on sensory experiences - the warmth of sunlight through the window, the smell of fresh coffee, the texture of his favorite wool blanket. These became our new language. Every morning, we'd sit together in silence, holding hands and watching the birds at our feeder. Some days he'd remember their names; other days he'd experience them like it was the first time. Both were beautiful in their own way.</p>
                <p>Now in year four of his diagnosis, we've created a rhythm to our days filled with these small, joyful moments. The way his face lights up when our granddaughter visits, even if he can't always recall her name. The pleasure he still gets from listening to his old jazz records. These moments remind me that while Alzheimer's has changed our relationship, it hasn't erased the essence of who James is.</p>
