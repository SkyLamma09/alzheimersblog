                <p>When my mother was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's, our family had no idea what to expect. The doctor explained it was early stage, but we didn't truly understand how our lives would change over the next decade.</p>
                
                <h2>The Early Years</h2>
                <p>For the first few years, the changes were subtle. Mom would forget where she put her keys or struggle to recall names of distant relatives. We made light of these moments, not realizing they were signs of what was to come.</p>
                
                <h2>The Middle Stages</h2>
                <p>By year five, things became more challenging. Mom began confusing family members, getting lost in familiar places, and needing help with daily tasks like dressing and bathing. We installed safety locks and created a structured routine.</p>
                
                <h2>The Later Years</h2>
                <p>The final years were the most difficult. Mom lost the ability to speak, then to walk, and eventually to swallow. Through hospice care, we kept her comfortable until the end. Looking back, I wish we had known more about what to expect at each stage.</p>
                
                <h2>What We Learned</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early planning is crucial - legal, financial and care decisions</li>
                    <li>Self-care for caregivers isn't selfish - it's necessary</li>
                    <li>Small moments of connection matter most when verbal communication fades</li>
                    <li>Community support makes the journey less isolating</li>
                </ul>
