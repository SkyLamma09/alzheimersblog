                <h1>Our 10-Year Alzheimer's Journey</h1>
                <p>When my mother was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2012, our family had little idea what to expect. The doctor explained it was early stage, and we naively thought we had years before any significant changes would occur. The reality was that subtle changes had already begun, and the progression, while gradual, was relentless.</p>
                <p>The first few years were marked by small forgetfulness - missed appointments, repeating questions, and difficulty finding words. What we didn't anticipate were the personality changes and emotional challenges. My once patient, gentle mother became easily frustrated and sometimes suspicious. Learning to navigate these changes while preserving her dignity became our family's mission.</p>
                <p>By year five, we needed professional help. We found an amazing day program that gave my mother structure and socialization while giving my father much-needed respite. The middle stages brought new challenges with daily tasks, but also moments of surprising clarity and connection. Now in the later stages, we've learned to cherish every moment of recognition, every smile, and every time she still says our names.</p>
